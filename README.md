# MSFS-SimHub-VFR-LCD-Dash
This is a simple yet completed dash made to mimick an old LCD screen. Mostly for VFR and back country flying purposes in sim. It also includes overspeed and stall warnings. Feel free to modify it as you like, just dont pawn it off as your own project please and credit this original post if sharing elsewhere.
